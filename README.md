# tic-tac-toe

The game is played on a grid that's three squares by three squares. You are X, and your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The winner is the first player to get three of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally). When all nine squares are complete, the game is over. The game ends in a tie if no player has three marks in a row.
